# IMDB-Clone

# Instructions
● Use the OMDB API: https://www.omdbapi.com/

● Home Page
    ○ Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as
        I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).

    ○ Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which
        the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).

    ○ On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more
        information about that movie (movie page)


● Movie Page
    ○ Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these
    are must, rest you can add if you want).


# OMDb API - The Open Movie Database
https://www.omdbapi.com
● My favourite movies Page
    ○ Display a list of all the favourite movies.

    ○ Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and
    after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).

    ○ Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites
    button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.
